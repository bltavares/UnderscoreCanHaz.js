#_CanHaz.js
## Js templates based on Underscore.js (and inspired on ICanHaz)

###Dependencies:
* Jquery
* Undescore.js

It looks similar to andyet's [ICanHaz.js](http://icanhazjs.com/) (It's inspired on it), but uses the [Underscore.js](http://documentcloud.github.com/underscore/) template istead of Mustache.js

_Probably you are using Jquery and Underscore already, right?_

Check the demo.
